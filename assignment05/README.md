# Question1

After investigations, we found that the best time step for question 1 is
dt=1e-3. Any further decrease to this time step yields no noticeable change
in the solution. The code outputs to a data file labelled "fort.1" and
"fort.2". "fort.1" contains the data for the odd wavefunctions while "fort.2"
contains the data for the even wavefunctions. As per instructions only the
trajectories shot off in the positive direction are given. The columns of
these files denote the x positions, the wavefunction, and the
first spatial derivative of the wavefunction, respectively. The solution
is then plotted in python and the output plot is given in "q1_plot.pdf".

# Question 2

The outputs will be on stdout when the runme.sh file is executed

# Question 3

The outputs will be on stdout when the runme.sh file is executed

# Question 4

The outputs are two pdfs titled "q4_wavefunctions_figure.pdf" and
"q4_densities_figure.pdf" for the wavefunctions and the probability densities,
respectively. Eigenvalues are output to stdout when the runme.sh file is
executed.

# Question 5

The outputs are two pdfs titled "q5_wavefunctions_figure.pdf" and
"q5_densities_figure.pdf" for the wavefunctions and the probability densities,
respectively. Eigenvalues are output to stdout when the runme.sh file is
executed.
